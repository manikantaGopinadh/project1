            Ooty is situated in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. Many of the forested areas and water 
            bodies are off-limits to most visitors in order to protect this fragile ecosystem. Some 
            areas of the Biosphere Reserve have been earmarked for tourism development, and steps are 
            being undertaken to open these areas to visitors whilst conserving the area. It is situated 
            at an altitude of 2,240 metres (7,350 feet) above sea level.

        <h1 class="rightheading">AGRA</h1>
        <p class="rightpara">
            The name Agra is explained by different derivations, all of which have low verifiability. 
            The most accepted one is that it had its origin from the Hindi word agar meaning salt-pan, 
            a name which was given to it because the soil in the region is brackish and salt used to be 
            made here once by evaporation. Others derive it from Hindu History claiming that the Sanskrit
             word agra which means the first of the many groves and little forests where Krishna 
             frolicked with the gopis of Vrindavan. The term Agravana hence means grove forest.

        <p class="leftpara">
            According to Hindu mythology, Varanasi was founded by Shiva,[34] one of three principal 
            deities along with Brahma and Vishnu. During a fight between Brahma and Shiva, one of 
            Brahma's five heads was torn off by Shiva. Since Brahma was a Brahmin, Shiva had committed 
            BrƒÅhmanahatya by killing him and as a result, the slain head of Brahma stuck to his hand. He 
            tried to remove the head, but was unsuccessful. Eventually, after wandering around the world 
            for eons, he came to the city of Varanasi in this state, and the hanging head of Brahma 
            dropped from Shiva's hand and disappeared in the ground. Varanasi is therefore considered an 
            extremely holy site.
